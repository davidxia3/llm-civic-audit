"We have one deferred paper, Bill 1572. Bill 1572 resolution authorizing the City of Pittsburgh to accept the sum of 316,367 in full and final settlement of litigation filed in the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas involving the Finland Street Pedestrian Bridge. Motion to approve Second brief discussion. Brief discussion. Councilman Gross, Thank you. I appreciate the administration meeting with me over this bill. It was an executive session. I think I'm supportive today- but I just wanted to say on the record that my concerns around pedestrian safety on this section of Bigelow Boulevard- This is a settlement, so it's not really anything that we can do much about- right, We've settled with. you know we've settled with the. you know we've settled with the. you know we've settled with the. you know we've settled with the. I think the company that caused damage to the Finland Street Pedestrian Bridge that went over Bigelow so severely that it had to be taken down, But that leaves us without that pedestrian infrastructure there. And then, if you'll recall, this is a pedestrian bridge that's in between the pedestrian bridge at the Bigelow, at the Bloomfield Bridge on Bigelow, And then, as you're inbound, it's going to be the installation. then your next safe crossing is at Heron Avenue, which is actually not very safe and we're working on and it is real concern for the neighborhood, and there are bus stops on either side. So you may be living uphill from Bigelow and needing to cross, or you may be living below hill on Bigelow and needing to cross to get to Port Authority bus stops. And so my ask is for Delmay to really do an audit of pedestrian safety and give suggestions of things that can be done. So that is still to be worked out. So right now you are able to cross at Heron and you're able to cross at the Bloomfield Bridge. So with that, I just wanted to get that on the record and it is work that remains in front of us. But I'm supportive of this bill today, which is just receiving funds from a legal settlement. Any further discussion? If not, I'll simply note that your concerns about that stretch of Bigelow are well founded and very understood. You said it before. but it's also worth noting that there used to be an underpass at the Heron Avenue intersection where you could go under the street, and the state decided to close that with no alert to the city. They just decided to do it. So your concerns are well founded. All those in favor say aye, Aye. Any opposed Aye. Affirmative recommendation.",3
That moves us to the new papers.,-1

"1660 resolution authorizing the mayor and the director of the Office of Management and Budget to enter into an agreement or agreements with USI Insurance Services for insurance brokerage services for all necessary policy types. This shall be a no cost payment to any insurance brokerage services for all necessary policy types. Motion agreement with a term of three years with two one-year options to extend. motion to approve brief discussion. second, I'm not sure I understand what this is. frankly, if it's a no cost, how can we have a no cost service? it's insurance brokerage. admittedly, I'm not. I apologize, I have not been briefed on this either. do we have anyone from the audience? Patrick Cornell, if you please come forward? sure, Jennifer, sorry I didn't see you over there I always. good morning, Patrick Cornell, chief financial officer. Jennifer Olesinger, chief procurement officer. so this is the end of an RFP for insurance brokerage services. it is a no-cost contract. that is because insurance policies are paid by the actual insurance providers as commissioned directly to the broker. so we will not pay this firm, but we will pay for the policies after the insurance broker is approved. so we will not pay this firm, but we will pay for the policies after the insurance broker has procured them on our behalf. curious standard for the industry and, and this is for all it says, all types of insurance policies. yes, when I just give us a really brief reminder of all of the types of insurance that we carry: we have a property coverage on our buildings. we have boat insurance. we have insurance for cameras that we have on property that is not ours, so if a camera falls and breaks or whatever on somebody else's property, it would cover any damage. we have a cybersecurity insurance. we have errors and emissions insurance for EMS and we have crime insurance for officers, elected officials. well, that was impressive and we proved our previous broker that that contract has expired. so we did a new RFP and we are actually we're switching brokers to a different. wonderful. what is the timeline that we expect to see you come back to the table for your so we good question? we wouldn't need to come back for those individual policies as they would just be routed through this, this broker, but the new policies would go into effect may 1. I do this all the time. I ask questions and then I start pulling on threads. I'm sorry, so I don't like these wide open, blanket kinds of papers. so that to requesting to enter into a brokerage is one thing, but that you've, if you've, embedded approval of the resulting policies in the same bill, that makes me cranky. so is that what's happening in front of us here? yes, the only thing I would add is that within OMB, City Council has approved the insurance premium payments in the current budget, and we're going to be able to get that back to you in the next couple of weeks. so I'm just going to go ahead and ask you a question and then I'll get back to you in a minute. so I'm going to go ahead and ask you a question and then I'll get back to you in a minute. so I'm going to go ahead and ask you a question and then I'll get back to you in a minute. so I'm going to go ahead and ask you a question and then I'll get back to you in a minute. so I'm going to in the regular budget process, not the same thing. we also have contract approval authority and so it having a sequence of events of contracts seems a little expiry- quiero tener unINKAL- tales a little- but is transparent. an it's our responsibility to protect and make sure there's transparency and things. I'm not going to belabor this today because I wasn't prepared. maybe I'm misunderstanding what I'm hearing, so I'll So I'll leave it there, but I will think about it before final vote. Appreciate it.

I believe- and excuse my ignorance- Fiona could probably help with this. Come on up, we're gonna bring her up, okay, I just feel like we've never done this before. Right, is this the first time for the? I'm sorry, you'll have to introduce yourself, Fiona Kalman, DBA for Public Safety at the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. So this is like. I don't remember seeing one of these bills before. is this a new thing for us That the police department has done? Yeah, Yeah. so we did go out nationally on OpenGov, bid out and then made sure that we met all compliances, and that has taken the process a lot more months than it typically would, but check the boxes and do what we could. So again, I don't know why I'm asking these questions, but it's new and it's interesting, Is it that they're gonna be filming here And so they're making shorts, and not necessarily in this room, but in Pittsburgh, Yes, Yes, With our officers. Yes, Yes, As far as what it's gonna look like, I don't know why it's entertaining. Okay, everybody's laughing, it's not just me, okay. Okay, so it's a recruitment video and we're paying 30,000 from a grant, so we're not really anything out of pocket, and hopefully it'll help with recruitment because it'll get on social media or digital media or someplace, And the company that we're going with, Yeah, We've also produced police videos for other cities as well, so they're qualified And it works, Hoping it works. yeah, we plan on having it work, But it worked in the other cities. Yeah, Oh, okay, That's great, all right. so I'm just thanks for answering my questions. I was just, you know, like I said, it's new, and so I was just curious how it was gonna work. Okay, Thank you. Yeah, that's all I have, Mr Chair. Thank you, Councilman. Sorry, There's nothing worse than a poorly timed, so I'll let you tickle. So I'm interested in this. I think we all are interested because it's a new thing, But I'm really glad to see you know. I think the last I heard is that we're starting to see recruitment number or the number of applicants, I should say, starting to go up again, which Correct, I believe is great. Can you talk to us about that at all? Sure, and I don't have the exact numbers, but kind of as a rough example, this, you know: past month, at the civil service examination that's tested monthly, we had roughly 170 people sign up to take it. i think 90 actually showed up, which is over double what we've seen in months prior. so too early to celebrate completely, but it seems our recruitment team, recruitment efforts are starting to bear fruit. that's that's something, something you should, you know, applaud yourself for and and the team that's working on this. that's quite, you know, really something to celebrate here. i, you know i think i've told the story at the table before, but i was in new york in the fall and i saw, you know, i was riding the subway and i saw advertisements like they have in their in their subway saying come join the police force. but it was come join the police force in atlanta. atlanta was advertising in new york subways. so this is is something that i think everybody's trying to figure out: how to be creative and and how to. you know, it's a nationwide issue. how do, how do we get to that point where we're, you know, keeping up with the joneses in terms of recruiting. so i'm i'm glad to see, you know, a video. i'll should probably use officer andre as your, as your, your actor here. i i don't, i don't know, i'm just i, i don't know. yeah, we're going to need volunteers. andre wright is, is your, your ham? so, but yeah, i mean, i i'm excited to see it and excited to see what comes out of this and i hope this bears fruit. so cool idea, thank you, thank you. any further discussion? seeing none. just, just, real, quickly, i just wanted to add: would you send us once, if approved, today, which and then tuesday it'll be final. would you send us all the, the actual product that you get? can you just email that to us? is that how you do that or what you know? like the video? yeah, what? yeah, i'm sure. yeah, right, yeah, i'll be able to send and share and okay, good, yeah, probably a couple months down the road, but, yeah, right, yeah, yeah, i'm just saying like, so we could see it. yeah, that's it, okay, good, can the council? that's it for me, mr president, he wants to be in there. well, i was going to pitch myself. but i mean, you are the public safety. i think i'm available. i mean, if you give me the dates and the times, i'll check my schedule. people often think you do look like a concept. you know what i might open that week. as a matter of fact, i pretend to be one. yeah, you look like one. that's it, mr president. sorry, we're gonna carry it away, thank you. i have one question: does this conflict in any way with our union cable workers? i know the rfp went out a long time ago. i know one of the concerns was the capability in terms of use of drones etc. i can't speak completely to that. i don't know. thank you, any further discussion seeing none. all those in favor say aye, aye. any opposed affirmative recommendation. thank you for being here, thank you. thank you, guys, thanks.",12
