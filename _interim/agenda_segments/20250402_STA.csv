**Section of meeting transcript:**
We have one deferred paper, Bill 1572. Bill 1572 resolution authorizing the City of Pittsburgh to accept the sum of 316,367 in full and final settlement of litigation filed in the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas involving the Finland Street Pedestrian Bridge. Motion to approve Second brief discussion. Brief discussion. Councilman Gross, Thank you. I appreciate the administration meeting with me over this bill. It was an executive session. I think I'm supportive today- but I just wanted to say on the record that my concerns around pedestrian safety on this section of Bigelow Boulevard- This is a settlement, so it's not really anything that we can do much about- right, We've settled with. you know we've settled with the. you know we've settled with the. you know we've settled with the. you know we've settled with the. I think the company that caused damage to the Finland Street Pedestrian Bridge that went over Bigelow so severely that it had to be taken down, But that leaves us without that pedestrian infrastructure there. And then, if you'll recall, this is a pedestrian bridge that's in between the pedestrian bridge at the Bigelow, at the Bloomfield Bridge on Bigelow, And then, as you're inbound, it's going to be the installation. then your next safe crossing is at Heron Avenue, which is actually not very safe and we're working on and it is real concern for the neighborhood, and there are bus stops on either side. So you may be living uphill from Bigelow and needing to cross, or you may be living below hill on Bigelow and needing to cross to get to Port Authority bus stops. And so my ask is for Delmay to really do an audit of pedestrian safety and give suggestions of things that can be done. So that is still to be worked out. So right now you are able to cross at Heron and you're able to cross at the Bloomfield Bridge. So with that, I just wanted to get that on the record and it is work that remains in front of us. But I'm supportive of this bill today, which is just receiving funds from a legal settlement. Any further discussion? If not, I'll simply note that your concerns about that stretch of Bigelow are well founded and very understood. You said it before. but it's also worth noting that there used to be an underpass at the Heron Avenue intersection where you could go under the street, and the state decided to close that with no alert to the city. They just decided to do it. So your concerns are well founded. All those in favor say aye, Aye. Any opposed Aye. Affirmative recommendation.

Motion agreement with a term of three years with two one-year options to extend. motion to approve brief discussion. second, I'm not sure I understand what this is. frankly, if it's a no cost, how can we have a no cost service? it's insurance brokerage. admittedly, I'm not. I apologize, I have not been briefed on this either. do we have anyone from the audience? Patrick Cornell, if you please come forward? sure, Jennifer, sorry I didn't see you over there I always. good morning, Patrick Cornell, chief financial officer. Jennifer Olesinger, chief procurement officer. so this is the end of an RFP for insurance brokerage services. it is a no-cost contract. that is because insurance policies are paid by the actual insurance providers as commissioned directly to the broker. so we will not pay this firm, but we will pay for the policies after the insurance broker is approved. so we will not pay this firm, but we will pay for the policies after the insurance broker has procured them on our behalf. curious standard for the industry and, and this is for all it says, all types of insurance policies. yes, when I just give us a really brief reminder of all of the types of insurance that we carry: we have a property coverage on our buildings. we have boat insurance. we have insurance for cameras that we have on property that is not ours, so if a camera falls and breaks or whatever on somebody else's property, it would cover any damage. we have a cybersecurity insurance. we have errors and emissions insurance for EMS and we have crime insurance for officers, elected officials. well, that was impressive and we proved our previous broker that that contract has expired. so we did a new RFP and we are actually we're switching brokers to a different. wonderful. what is the timeline that we expect to see you come back to the table for your so we good question? we wouldn't need to come back for those individual policies as they would just be routed through this, this broker, but the new policies would go into effect may 1. I do this all the time. I ask questions and then I start pulling on threads. I'm sorry, so I don't like these wide open, blanket kinds of papers. so that to requesting to enter into a brokerage is one thing, but that you've, if you've, embedded approval of the resulting policies in the same bill, that makes me cranky. so is that what's happening in front of us here? yes, the only thing I would add is that within OMB, City Council has approved the insurance premium payments in the current budget, and we're going to be able to get that back to you in the next couple of weeks. so I'm just going to go ahead and ask you a question and then I'll get back to you in a minute. so I'm going to go ahead and ask you a question and then I'll get back to you in a minute. so I'm going to go ahead and ask you a question and then I'll get back to you in a minute. so I'm going to go ahead and ask you a question and then I'll get back to you in a minute. so I'm going to in the regular budget process, not the same thing. we also have contract approval authority and so it having a sequence of events of contracts seems a little expiry- quiero tener unINKAL- tales a little- but is transparent. an it's our responsibility to protect and make sure there's transparency and things. I'm not going to belabor this today because I wasn't prepared. maybe I'm misunderstanding what I'm hearing, so I'll So I'll leave it there, but I will think about it before final vote. Appreciate it. That's all I have, Mr Chair, Thank you. Any further discussion Seeing none. all those in favor say aye, Aye. Any opposed. Any abstentions: Affirmative recommendation.

I believe- and excuse my ignorance- Fiona could probably help with this. Come on up, we're gonna bring her up, okay, I just feel like we've never done this before. Right, is this the first time for the? I'm sorry, you'll have to introduce yourself, Fiona Kalman, DBA for Public Safety at the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. So this is like. I don't remember seeing one of these bills before. is this a new thing for us That the police department has done? Yeah, Yeah. so we did go out nationally on OpenGov, bid out and then made sure that we met all compliances, and that has taken the process a lot more months than it typically would, but check the boxes and do what we could. So again, I don't know why I'm asking these questions, but it's new and it's interesting, Is it that they're gonna be filming here And so they're making shorts, and not necessarily in this room, but in Pittsburgh, Yes, Yes, With our officers. Yes, Yes, As far as what it's gonna look like, I don't know why it's entertaining. Okay, everybody's laughing, it's not just me, okay. Okay, so it's a recruitment video and we're paying 30,000 from a grant, so we're not really anything out of pocket, and hopefully it'll help with recruitment because it'll get on social media or digital media or someplace, And the company that we're going with, Yeah, We've also produced police videos for other cities as well, so they're qualified And it works, Hoping it works. yeah, we plan on having it work, But it worked in the other cities. Yeah, Oh, okay, That's great, all right. so I'm just thanks for answering my questions. I was just, you know, like I said, it's new, and so I was just curious how it was gonna work. Okay, Thank you. Yeah, that's all I have, Mr Chair. Thank you, Councilman. Sorry, There's nothing worse than a poorly timed, so I'll let you tickle. So I'm interested in this. I think we all are interested because it's a new thing, But I'm really glad to see you know. I think the last I heard is that we're starting to see recruitment number or the number of applicants, I should say, starting to go up again, which Correct, I believe is great. Can you talk to us about that at all? Sure, and I don't have the exact numbers, but kind of as a rough example, this, you know: past month, at the civil service examination that's tested monthly, we had roughly 170 people sign up to take it. i think 90 actually showed up, which is over double what we've seen in months prior. so too early to celebrate completely, but it seems our recruitment team, recruitment efforts are starting to bear fruit. that's that's something, something you should, you know, applaud yourself for and and the team that's working on this. that's quite, you know, really something to celebrate here. i, you know i think i've told the story at the table before, but i was in new york in the fall and i saw, you know, i was riding the subway and i saw advertisements like they have in their in their subway saying come join the police force. but it was come join the police force in atlanta. atlanta was advertising in new york subways. so this is is something that i think everybody's trying to figure out: how to be creative and and how to. you know, it's a nationwide issue. how do, how do we get to that point where we're, you know, keeping up with the joneses in terms of recruiting. so i'm i'm glad to see, you know, a video. i'll should probably use officer andre as your, as your, your actor here. i i don't, i don't know, i'm just i, i don't know. yeah, we're going to need volunteers. andre wright is, is your, your ham? so, but yeah, i mean, i i'm excited to see it and excited to see what comes out of this and i hope this bears fruit. so cool idea, thank you, thank you. any further discussion? seeing none. just, just, real, quickly, i just wanted to add: would you send us once, if approved, today, which and then tuesday it'll be final. would you send us all the, the actual product that you get? can you just email that to us? is that how you do that or what you know? like the video? yeah, what? yeah, i'm sure. yeah, right, yeah, i'll be able to send and share and okay, good, yeah, probably a couple months down the road, but, yeah, right, yeah, yeah, i'm just saying like, so we could see it. yeah, that's it, okay, good, can the council? that's it for me, mr president, he wants to be in there. well, i was going to pitch myself. but i mean, you are the public safety. i think i'm available. i mean, if you give me the dates and the times, i'll check my schedule. people often think you do look like a concept. you know what i might open that week. as a matter of fact, i pretend to be one. yeah, you look like one. that's it, mr president. sorry, we're gonna carry it away, thank you. i have one question: does this conflict in any way with our union cable workers? i know the rfp went out a long time ago. i know one of the concerns was the capability in terms of use of drones etc. i can't speak completely to that. i don't know. thank you, any further discussion seeing none. all those in favor say aye, aye. any opposed affirmative recommendation. thank you for being here, thank you. thank you, guys, thanks.

A motion to a man That could free discussion That. the second motion to approve both bills first. All right, motion to approve. check that. and I think your motion. I'm assuming you're in by substitution, so take both of those together. yeah. motion to amend. second: brief discussion discussion. yes, i just wanted to provide some context. you know this has been part of a multi-year process that started before my tenure on council between neighborhood groups and larmer neighborhood groups in east liberty, the developer as well as my predecessor, reverend burgess. that resulted in a community benefits agreement which includes the build 100 program that my office now has taken the lead on, working with the developer and the community groups. that will result and at some point in the future, of 100 affordable homes for purchase in the eastern community, particularly in larmer, but it may extend into lincoln, levington and homewood at some point and also- this is part of negotiations that i participated in with the mayor- that will include a 10 affordable rental housing on site at 50 ami and then 5 at 80 to 120 ami and that'll. there's just information in that as well. but this is just to send this over, you know, for a public hearing. i know there's going to be a lot of robust conversation and consideration about this. i welcome that. i look forward to discussing this further, but i do want to applaud the larmer consensus group and the village collaborative for the hard work that they've done over the last three or four years, you know, to move this forward. so i just want to give a little bit of context of what we're looking at. and again, this is part of a community benefits agreement negotiation that took place between the communities, as well as more recent negotiations between the mayor's office and myself around some on-site affordability. that was not part of the original community benefits agreement. all the affordability was going to be off-site and we were able to negotiate on-site affordability as well. so i just want to provide some context. thank you, so we have an amendment by substitution on the table. is there any further discussion? councilman, will you just tell me what? you said it, but i didn't catch it. what are the amis? affordability, off-site- i believe it's going to be 80 ami for affordable home purchase and then on-site it will be 50% at 50 and 5% at 80 to 120. okay, thank you. any further discussion? if none, i'll simply congratulate you. i do remember when reverend burgess sort of started this and for you to now be able to get it. it's not fully across the finish line, but there i know there's been a lot of work to reach both consensus within the neighborhood as it relates to both the off-site affordability and the four home, the home ownership opportunities, as well as the on-site affordability. so i congratulate you on that and i hope that you will continue to do that. and i hope that you will continue to do that and i hope that you will continue to do that. and i know you've been working on this since you took office, so there's been a lot of work to get to this point. so i just want to congratulate you, and i also want to congratulate sean carter, because i know you were working on this long before i was. so all those in favor say aye, aye, aye. any opposed? so the bills have been amended by substitution. now you, i believe these have to be held for a public hearing. so if you want to make a motion to hold both bills for cable cars public hearing, most of the whole. for a cable cast public hearing. second, all those in favor say aye, aye, aye, any opposed. both bills will be held for a cable cast public hearing.

**Section of meeting transcript:**
and lastly, bill 1659. bill 1659 resolution authorizing the mayor and the director of the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure, on behalf of the city of Pittsburgh, to enter into an agility agreement with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation for purposes of exchange, documentation and cooperation with respect to provision of in-kind services between both parties at no cost to the city. motion to approve any discussion. one question just out of curiosity. I'm just curious what agility agreement is. why'd you ask the NFL? that's what they're doing in the NFL, don't they? why'd you ask the NFL? that's what they're doing in the NFL, don't they? this is the director Lucious, hopefully. just one quick question, I'm just just out of curiosity. Kim Lucas, director for the city of Pittsburgh's Department of Mobility and Infrastructure. the agility agreement is a no-cost agreement between us and PennDOT that just tracks things that we basically borrow from them. so in this instance, sometimes we need to use their crash vehicle to help protect the work that we're doing in the right-of-way, and there are sometimes a lot of times we're not able to pay for the work that we're doing in the right-of-way, and there are sometimes a lot of times we're not able to pay for the work, that they need some assistance of that type from us and so this is just a way to not have to pay each other but instead to track sort of what we're borrowing. thank you, thank you. any further discussion if not all those in favor say aye. any opposed affirmative recommendation? I actually want to go back and I apologize because I didn't see this until just now, but I got a note from Patrick Cornell regarding the ability to pay for the work that they're doing in the area and I'm going to go back and I apologize because I didn't see this until just now, but I got a note from Patrick Cornell regarding bill 1675 and councilwoman Strasburgers in the finance, which is regarding councilman's bill to sponsor, which councilman Wilson sponsored a land sale but the real estate team was unaware the parcel was struck from her November resolution and he couldn't immediately tell if it went through the full process again and he wants time to make sure that everything is done by the book with councilman Wilson. he's not against it, he just wants to make sure all I's are dotted and T's are crossed. so if someone wants to make sure that they're not in the way of the plan, then he's not going to be able to get a motion to reconsider the bill 1675 so moved. second, all those in favor say aye, aye. and he's asking for a one-week cold to meet with councilman Wilson to make sure everything is appropriate. so can we make, make a go, make a motion over one week. second, all those in favor say aye. any opposed bill be held for one week. thank you all. that takes us to the end of our agenda.
