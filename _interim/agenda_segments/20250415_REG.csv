**Section of meeting transcript:**
well, I'd like to call for a motion for a public hearing on our trash situation in Pittsburgh. Just to make sure members know. after We did the will of counsel last week, My office has been blowing up with people with a lot of really good ideas For what we can do to fix our trash problem here throughout for the entire city, from all of your districts. we've kind of become a- I Don't know a- nexus of this conversation. So we'd really like to hold a public hearing. We'd like it to be in the evening as an opportunity to bring people in and hear from their ideas on what we can do to Solve this trash issue here. So I'd like to make that motion second. second: all those in favor Please say aye, aye, post extensions, motion passes. We will get that scheduled, Thank you. And one last thing: I did ask for a briefing on the CEO works Initiative that is in Homewood, how we can ask for other neighborhoods to apply. I make sure this benefits the whole city. So that, I believe, is in the process of being scheduled right now. Thank you, Councilman Mosley. Yeah, I just wanted to echo the comments of my colleagues about Unfortunate situation that happened at the governor's mansion over the weekend. I've known governor Shapiro For two decades. met him, you know, When we were much younger, when he served in the state legislature with my wife and I'm, you know, Consider him a friend. I've known his family For a long time. So my heart goes out to the governor First and foremost. but, like my colleagues said so eloquently earlier, this really underscores, You know, the unfortunate state of our current politics And it's so, very, so important that you know We can get to a point where you know We can agree without being disagreeable and work together on issues you know and come together because you know, I think, That you know it's not overreacting to start. you're being concerned about, you know, Our own safety as elected officials on every level of government. as you know, these heinous acts you know continue from, You know, what happened in Butler, PA, last summer To what happened at the governor's mansion this weekend. So I hope at some point we can get to a point where You know our public officials are not under attack And and and folks can't disagree with us and we can have robust Dialogue and debate, you know, in the true democratic spirit, without people resorting to violence. So again, you know, I, just you know- fear for the future and hope that you know these, these, this is an aberration and Not a trend. and then I also do want to wish all those who are celebrating Passover a joyous and prosperous Passover celebration as well. Thank you, councilman. anything further from members Seeing none?
