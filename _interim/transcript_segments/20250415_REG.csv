We will now move on to the motion and resolution.,-1
"We will now move on to the motion and resolution. So anything from members? Yes, Council Member Warwick. Yes, Council Member Warwick. I just wanted to make a quick comment, That's OK. Yeah, So I just you know, with regard to the attack on Governor Shapiro's House and on his family over the weekend: Obviously horrific attack and terrifying. I can't imagine how stressful that is for the governor and his wife and their kids. But more than that, I just wanted to note the fact that our president referred to the attacker as just some whack job, as if this was some random situation. and it wasn't and it didn't have anything to do with the fact that this is a Jewish governor and that the attack was on the first night of Passover. to sort of wave it off as just some random situation, while at the same time, you know, actively disappearing from the picture Legal residents in the United States to foreign countries under the claim that they are terrorists, with no evidence whatsoever, totally illegal and totally unconstitutional. It's just, it's very scary, And I just wanted to mention it because I know that you know we're all here at city council, we're going about our business, we're doing you know we're going through an election, et cetera, et cetera. you know what I mean And I just wanted to mention it because I know that you know we're all here at We're going through an election, et cetera, et cetera, and everyone is doing that. right, Everyone is just going about their day and going to work and doing the things that we have to do, but people are feeling it and people and it's frightening and I just want to acknowledge that, acknowledge that that is, you know, that sentiment here in Pittsburgh and all across the country, that you know that we are aware here at City Council and that we appreciate the way that everyone is feeling, and certainly you know the way that our Jewish community members are feeling, given this attack on Sunday. So that's all from me. Thank you. Thank you, Council Member. Is there anything further from members? Yes, Council Member, Strassberger, Council. thank you, Councilman Wilson, followed by Councilwoman Kale-Smith, Thank you. If I may, I'd like to register aye votes for the votes that I missed. So noted, Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Kale-Smith. Thank you, Thank you. I think this is just, I might say, half a bell on this, a lot. but there's just one thing that's interesting, which is obviously participation- and having a conversation about this is really packed with- is not relying on Generally Support all the time, But we again, I guess, just for the. I'm just wondering if we can. Council Member Warren, Was there a school day that we didn't get an existing? No, not, we didn't. people help and trying to make sure that, and there's people here locally. I mean, I know that on the national level there's a lot going on and I leave that to our congresswoman. I know that she's, you know, doing what she can on that level. but on this level, in the city of Pittsburgh, there's people missing, there's people going missing. there's things that are happening in the city of Pittsburgh on a daily basis that needs addressed by this council and by this administration, because otherwise we're focusing on things we weren't elected to do. but we can do both, but our focus should be predominantly on what's happening in the city of Pittsburgh. that's what we're elected to do and for me, I really I see kids missing all the time in the city of Pittsburgh. every week there's somebody going that you see a post that somebody has gone missing and to try to find that person. and, honestly, there's a lot to be said about what's happening in the homes of these, of our kids, and I think the more we just ignore this and just act like this is normal, the the worse, it's becoming, not better, and I think that we need to address what's happening here in Pittsburgh in terms of our young people leaving homes, missing, homes going missing. there's just a lot. I mean, it's just so much. it's it's depressing, it really is. it's depressing- of what's happening, you know, and in our neighborhoods and each and every day and in our, the homes of kids across the city of Pittsburgh, and I wish we would do more partnering with, you know, DHS and CYF and others to get resources into and and and even our, our rec centers. they should have those resources available where kids are not just in schools but places where kids can get them after school hours or a place where they can reach, you know, resources more comfortably, and I just wish we would do more with that. and I know council on work and I are talking about a couple things with schools and and doing some partnerships in the evenings and other times, but I think generally across the city of Pittsburgh it needs to be done and I'm I know in Sheridan we have there's a lot of youth crime in the community in that area- 15, 16- There's a lot for kids to do and I tell people this all the time: if having something to do was Meant that there would be safety and kids would be safe, Homewood and Sheridan would be some of the safest neighborhoods because they have some of the best Resources. and Sheridan, they have the Jasmine- I read they have this Langley's supposed to be a community-based school Which is supposed to have programs available. They have the library, they have parks, They have people doing like hope for tomorrow and the boxing program at Langley. I know there's a lot of programs in homeward because I used to partner with them and different things. But the problem is is that we set an expectation That an absence is something to do, is is it's okay to commit a crime, And what we ought to be doing is setting the bar a little bit higher for our kids, expecting a lot more for them and Trying to lead them in a better direction. And I just feel like, yes, there should be some more things for people to do. and yes, I'm eager for the Stevens school building to open. You know it has not opened and I do feel like it has been intentionally not open, delayed because it's needs so much work and And there's a. I could say a lot to that and I will say a lot. the conversation continues. I'll say a lot publicly every week, But what I'll say now is there's a lot of projects delayed in our district that would help kids and would do more for kids, But that's still not the overall answer. The answer is yes, give them some things, But let's also remember that we've got to set the bar high for our kids and teach them a little better like they do. in short, to your city, where it's. there's almost nothing for the kids to do down there except for Park in a ball field, But yet it has the highest, some of the highest, homeownership in the city of Pittsburgh, low crime, the kids Succeeding and doing well, and I think it's because they set the bar so high, so I just was. it's when the community embraces everybody. I think it's it's coming together that we need to do a little bit all over the country, all over the city of Pittsburgh. Thank you, Thanks, councilwoman. anything further from members. I think I saw council person Charlene first, followed by council and Mosley. All right, Yeah, thank you. I would like to call for a motion for a.",-1
"well, I'd like to call for a motion for a public hearing on our trash situation in Pittsburgh. Just to make sure members know. after We did the will of counsel last week, My office has been blowing up with people with a lot of really good ideas For what we can do to fix our trash problem here throughout for the entire city, from all of your districts. we've kind of become a- I Don't know a- nexus of this conversation. So we'd really like to hold a public hearing. We'd like it to be in the evening as an opportunity to bring people in and hear from their ideas on what we can do to Solve this trash issue here. So I'd like to make that motion second. second: all those in favor Please say aye, aye, post extensions, motion passes. We will get that scheduled, Thank you. And one last thing: I did ask for a briefing on the CEO works Initiative that is in Homewood, how we can ask for other neighborhoods to apply. I make sure this benefits the whole city. So that, I believe, is in the process of being scheduled right now. Thank you, Councilman Mosley. Yeah, I just wanted to echo the comments of my colleagues about Unfortunate situation that happened at the governor's mansion over the weekend. I've known governor Shapiro For two decades. met him, you know, When we were much younger, when he served in the state legislature with my wife and I'm, you know, Consider him a friend. I've known his family For a long time. So my heart goes out to the governor First and foremost. but, like my colleagues said so eloquently earlier, this really underscores, You know, the unfortunate state of our current politics And it's so, very, so important that you know We can get to a point where you know We can agree without being disagreeable and work together on issues you know and come together because you know, I think, That you know it's not overreacting to start. you're being concerned about, you know, Our own safety as elected officials on every level of government. as you know, these heinous acts you know continue from, You know, what happened in Butler, PA, last summer To what happened at the governor's mansion this weekend. So I hope at some point we can get to a point where You know our public officials are not under attack And and and folks can't disagree with us and we can have robust Dialogue and debate, you know, in the true democratic spirit, without people resorting to violence. So again, you know, I, just you know- fear for the future and hope that you know these, these, this is an aberration and Not a trend. and then I also do want to wish all those who are celebrating Passover a joyous and prosperous Passover celebration as well. Thank you, councilman. anything further from members Seeing none?",32
