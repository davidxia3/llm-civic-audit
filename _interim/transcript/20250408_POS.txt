Good afternoon. Welcome to Pittsburgh City Council's cablecast post agenda on the Vision Zero annual memo for today, April 8th 2025. We'll start off with our guests, if you all want to introduce yourselves, and then I'll let you kick it off with your presentation. Stephanie Gagne, Management Analyst for the City. Angie Martinez: I'm Assistant Director with the City's Department of Mobility and Infrastructure. Or Domi Panini Aminchotri, Senior Planning Manager of Transportation, with Domi Takina Wai, Assistant Director of Public Safety. Lisa Frank: I'm the City's Chief Operating Administrative Officer. Matt Jengieski, Director of Enforcement and Meter Services with the Pittsburgh Parking Authority. Okay, go ahead. All right, thank you. All right, let me get started here. So we are going to run through information. We're going to start with a presentation today talking about why we chose Vision Zero as our strategy to achieve zero traffic fatalities and serious injuries, what our commitment looks like- our first year, our intergovernmental working group and Vision Zero subcommittees, as well as 2025 and beyond. All right. So the reason we chose to commit to Vision Zero Last year. Mayor Gini has been consistent that his North Star is making Pittsburgh the safest city in America. We can only do this by making sure this touches all aspects of public safety. So, on average, each year, 20 people are killed due to crashes and about 123 people are seriously injured. We know this number is unacceptable and the only acceptable number is zero. By committing to Vision Zero, we are committing To solving this problem through a holistic approach and establishing partnerships across sectors to solve this issue. So, as I mentioned last March, Mayor Gini and Council Member Warwick partnered to pass legislation that formally commits the city to Vision Zero. This legislation also directed departments to form an interdepartmental working group that we have now formed and we will get into a little bit later in this presentation. So we have a new working group that we have now formed and we will get into a little bit later in this presentation. This is a new working group that we have now formed and we will get into a little bit later in this presentation. This is a new working group that we have now formed and we will get into a little bit later in this presentation. Pittsburgh now joins multiple other cities throughout the Commonwealth, for example, Bethlehem, Harrisburg, Lancaster and Philadelphia, in adopting Vision Zero. Pittsburgh now joins multiple other cities throughout the Commonwealth, for example, Bethlehem, Harrisburg, Lancaster and Philadelphia, in adopting Vision Zero. We are also joining cities from all across the United States as well as other countries. So the purpose of our blossoming mission, passion and survivalp company to be creative is based on ideas, based on theétait tal catastividade, Mueller, Combat, doubt and its recite flute firm Pip Pope is the direct weapon that gives resources to the effective people in Washington Army. Sorry of our working group is to make sure we're eliminating interdepartmental and interagency barriers to collaboration so that we can design and implement engineering, educational and enforcement solutions to ensure zero drivers, pedestrians or cyclists are killed and seriously injured on our streets. we've established this working group with director level leadership from various departments and agencies, including the mayor's office, city council, the department of mobility and infrastructure, public safety, the police, public works, the law department, the department of innovation and performance, the office of management and budget, the department of city planning, parking authority, allegheny county, penn, dot pittsburgh, regional transit and the southwestern pennsylvania commission. so, as you can see, these are a vast leadership majority that we're working together to achieve vision zero and this group really sets the vision and assigns work to representatives on more of a staff level in our subcommittee so that they can work on things on a more day-to-day basis. so, getting a little bit into each of our subcommittees, one of the ones we knew we had to establish right off the bat was one dedicated to enforcement. so, as you can see, we we have representatives from the mayor's office, council, omb, domey, police, public safety, imp and the parking authority. one of the things that we really wanted to kick off immediately with this subcommittee was automated red light enforcement. so, as of last fall, we had legislation introduced and passed that authorized automated red light enforcement at the local level, and we're working with the subcommittee to get that done. and we're working with the subcommittee to get that done. and we're working with the subcommittee to get that done. and we're working with the subcommittee to get that done. and we're currently in the process- the bid process- for selecting a vendor to launch that program this year. so we'll be able to launch to multiple locations- see how that goes- and we will be joining other cities in the commonwealth as well, like philadelphia, who has shown that this kind of program can help to reduce crashes and especially fatal and serious injury crashes. we're just quickly just to mention that we've been joined by council member mosley, so thanks. we're just quickly just to mention that we've been joined by council member mosley, so thanks, thanks. we're also working on an education and enforcement program. i'm partnering with our police, our safer together coordinators in public safety, as well as our zone councils to look at the parking issues in particular of each neighborhood. so, for example, if you have a lot of sidewalk parking in your neighborhood, maybe people are parking on the ada ramps. what we're doing for this particular program is going to be educating our neighbors first and foremost, because a lot of people don't understand that when you park on a sidewalk or you're blocking an ada ramp, you are making it very unsafe for people walking using mobility devices as well as pushing strollers and things like that. so we would like to start with educating before moving into partnering with our police to enforce, if necessary, and write tickets. we will also be starting to coordinate advocacy efforts at the state level for automated speed enforcement. that's something we'd really like to, that's something we would really like to be allowable by the state and that currently isn't authorized for pittsburgh. i'm so looking into what kind of advocacy efforts we need to do to make sure we have all tools in the toolbox for enforcement. oh sorry, we've also been joined by councilman gross as well. thank you. moving on to our next subcommittee, we established a budget subcommittee that includes members from the mayor's office, council, omb, domi and dcp, and a few things we've been working on on the budget subcommittee in particular is around the grants process: working to improve the process internally, making sure that we have very simple things like a centralized sharepoint tracker for grants, that we are setting strict go or no go deadlines so that we are being efficient and effective with our grant applications. we've also engaged domey's complete streets advisory group around the budget and we will continue to do so. last year we engaged with them around the draft budget and they came back with recommendations for us, which was much appreciated. we've also been able to secure millions of dollars in funding for vision zero initiatives, whether through grants or through the regular operating in capital budgets for things like automated red light enforcement, sidewalks and traffic calming. our next subcommittee that we established is education, engagement in communications, and this one is probably our largest group with representatives from the mayor's office, council, omb, domi, public safety, city planning, allegheny county. we have been doing a number of initiatives through this subcommittee. first and foremost, we wanted to engage students and their families. so, building upon domey's pre-existing safe routes to school program, we partnered with the safe routes to school coordinator to create trifolds for walk and roll to school day in the fall so that we could educate kids and their families about safety and safety in the school district. and we've also engaged with the education engagement in communications and the school district so that we could educate them about safe travel when they're getting to school, to and from school, as well as general road safety. so some of our members of our committee were stationed outside those schools so that when parents were coming up to drop their kids off, we could have conversations with them and hand out information. we'll be continuing to do that in the spring as well and working with them during safe routes to school safety week, which happened just last month. to create vision zero pledges for the. We've also recently launched a community safety agreement which is available on the Engage page- the Vision Zero Engage page- that commits residents and people traveling through our city to driving safely, following all traffic signals and stop signs, wearing your seat belt, And that is paired with statistics about safe driving. So people may not know that a majority of our crashes, or a decent number of our crashes, if not the majority, are caused by red light running. I think it's around 35%. So things like that that bring light to the issue but also have an action item for people to take to become further involved in Vision Zero and do their part. We're going to be continuing to work with the Complete Streets Advisory Group. as they get up and running, They're going to be working with their new member chair. We're going to use them as a sounding board as well for all of our work and initiatives. Our Community Ambassador Program is currently in progress. We are working to execute our Safe Streets for All grant agreement with federal DOT. So once that is executed we can begin that process of an RFP going out for our projects listed within that grant And then we can start to work with our community ambassador program, which will be basically sending folks out to priority neighborhoods, making sure that that education piece is really being worked on in the neighborhoods that are most needed. We plan to launch a safe driver training for city staff. We are looking to make it required for staff that have to drive for their jobs. We are just starting that process now of what that would look like, But we'd also love to open up for a new driver. We're going to open it up to other staff who drive, just not for work to make sure that we are all on the same page when it comes to traffic safety and driving safety. And finally, a community traffic calming toolkit. We'd like to work on this to empower residents to be able to make quick build traffic calming in their neighborhood. So we have actively applied for a grant for this opportunity. We're waiting to hear back And, depending on the results of that, we'll hopefully be looking into launching that this year. And I should note we're joined by Councilwoman Strasburger. Thanks, Finally, our last subcommittee includes the Fatal Crash Response Team. So that includes a number of our departments: the mayor's office, the police collision investigation unit, DOMI, OMB, DPW, the SPC and the county or PennDOT, depending on whose road it is. So for this subcommittee it's a little bit different than the rest. We only meet when there is a fatal crash. Within two weeks of a fatal crash occurring, we'll go out and complete a site visit And we have a standardized process. So at those site visits we have a questionnaire basically that we fill out And to make sure that the data that we are collecting for each fatal crash is consistent, we are making sure that we are communicating our updates on the Vision Zero Engage page in a formalized way, as well as our public safety information officers communicating each time a fatal crash occurs that our team will be going out and completing a site visit. Since the launch of this group, we've completed six site visits in 2024 and four so far in 2025. We are now in the process of completing three site visits in 2021. So we are now in the process of completing three site visits in 2021. I just wanted to share a quick example because I think it's easier to understand when you have visuals. So this is one of the ones we did early last year, early on in our process, at the Boulevard of the Allies and Marion Street, just down the street from us. We had two fatal crashes here last year And, as you can see on the left-hand side, that is the before. So you can see that left turn lane. That's actually an emergency-only lane. There is signage up, but the pavement markings only showed just a white diamond, which may have been confusing to folks. So what we did was work with PennDOT because it's their road, And we worked with them to get some yellow hatching to make it very clear that you should not be using this left turn lane as a turn lane or a turnaround. We got increased signage up and we haven't seen any fatal crashes since. So we're going to go ahead and get started, Thank you. This is also just a local example of Paulson and Rowan Street. We had seen a fatal crash here. Somebody driving- we believe that he may not have known there was a curve. So what we did was make sure that there was signage there to really make clear that you need to slow down, Do not speed through this intersection because there is a curve ahead. So just making simple fixes can make it much safer. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you. And just to sum up, last year, which was year one of the initiative, we did see a decrease in traffic fatalities last year, with 17 total fatal crashes. Like I said, we know this number is 17 too many. It needs to be zero, But we're hoping this is on the right track And we know that the work is just beginning and it's not going to happen overnight overnight, but we feel we are making progress, breaking down barriers to coordination and we're looking forward to further collaboration with agencies, organizations and community members to achieve our goal. going into a little bit about our upcoming goals, we will be hosting a vision zero summit, a one-day summit with bike pittsburgh in fall of 2025, which we're really looking forward to. this will be a great opportunity for people to come out and learn more about the work we're doing and help kind of plan for the year ahead. we'll be working on drafting and submitting a vision zero budget ask for 2026. that's cross-departmental, so it's not all just going to come from one department, because this is truly a cross-departmental issue. we'll be expanding the reach of the fatal crash response group by reviewing the data and the data that we're going to be using to help us with that. and we're also doing serious injury crashes and high crash police zones, starting with zone 2 with the intent to expand city-wide. so making sure we're solving for the problem of that data lag by meeting on a more quarterly basis with commanders who can tell us what's going on in their zones. and finally, we'd like to establish a subcommittee that is focused on policy and legislative priorities so that we can make sure we're doing everything in our power to create safer streets in pittsburgh. so we do have the memo up on the vision zero engage page, along with our community safety agreement, which we encourage everybody listening to fill out, and i believe the memo will outline all of our action items. they are color coded and we do have a majority of them that are either completed or on track for 2025 and for the rest of them, we're looking forward to getting those on their way. thank you great. thank you very much. does anyone else have anything to add? before we move to to questions from members? no, okay, thank you. i want to thank you everyone for being here today. thank you for that a very detailed presentation. my first question is: you know, whether here locally or nationally, what is your role in this situation? i think that is a critical question. yeah, thank you. are there successful examples and best practices around education and advocacy programs? The reason why I ask that question, as Angie knows, I constantly are sending emails over to Domi from the numerous traffic common requests we get from residents all over the city, And I know there used to be the old saying: everybody wants a chicken in every pot and a cop on every block. I think nowadays everybody wants a speed bump on their street And we know that it's just not conceivable to have a speed bump on every single street And we can only do so much from where we sit to manage people's driving behavior, And I try to get that across to our residents. I just got an email, actually this morning, about a near accident over in the Friendship community where someone was speeding and almost hit a car, Hit a family, And I know that as much as we would love to be able to do traffic calming on every single block in the entire city, we just know that's not reality. But can you speak to- or you or anyone else on the panel can speak to- successful education and advocacy programs that have shown the change of behavior over time? Because unless people drive more responsibly, there's only so much that we can do around traffic calming and interventions we can make. So I'm just curious to know if you have any thoughts on that. I'd like to go ahead and start to address that comment. So this is Angie with Domi And I have to say exactly So that is why we are doing a Vision Zero initiative, Because we know that roadway safety is not going to be end all be all roadway design or infrastructure solutions. We know that we have to get at the behavior of everyone, Whether they are driving, Whether they are walking, Using a mobility assisted device Or on a bike or other sort of conveyance. And so I think we did look at best practices And what we've seen, and we are by no means the first city to do a Vision Zero program. I think we have actually really benefited in some ways from coming along a little bit later in the game. We've seen these policies and programs take root Nationally, internationally And even within the state of Pennsylvania. So we're here to really say these things work. Safety can't wait From the Domi perspective, But we need residents, visitors, Everybody in the city of Pittsburgh, to understand the importance of roadway safety and rules of the roads. But we also want them to drive with compassion And to think about other, the experience of others, as they're moving through our city. And the only thing that I can say is that, you know, we've been here for a long time And we've been here for a long time And we've been here for a long time And we've been here for a long time And we've been here for a long time, And the only way we're going to accomplish that is by working holistically And beyond just a Department of Transportation. So I have been so gratified and really pleased with, I think, the diversity of representation we've had from various city and external departments. You know, having our Safer Together coordinators, who receive a lot of those same 311s that ultimately come to Domi, Having parking authority who's got the sort of enforcement capacity and has to deal with. you know, processing violations for some of these types of behaviors really starts with getting everybody in the room and understanding what our respective roles are. And then, I think, more outlets like this so that members of council and, by extension, the public can see the work that we're doing, that we're collaborating, that we know the solutions go beyond just in small speed humps. And so we've, we plan on doing a number of behavioral or more education campaigns. One of the ones that I was able to take a part of this year was the safety pledge that our education and communications committee put together with Harriet Jackson, who's our Safe Routes to School coordinator. We were at Propel Northside for safety week, talking to- I believe it was- fifth graders And we walked them through the safety pledge And they all signed the pledge and got a seat Sticker that they would, you know, follow the rules of the road and look out for others, So that safety pledge would not have happened. We would not have had that material to present to our Northside Propel scholars if Vision Zero hadn't convened, if we weren't able to use both our education committee and our Complete Streets Advisory Group as external reviewers of the materials. So that, I think, is just one example of something that we were able to do sort of on the education piece And if there's anything that anyone else wants to add. But, Panini, you go first, Councilman, to answer your question. yes, Education is a proven safety counter measure. So we actually have a National Highway Transportation Safety NHTSA. They do a lot of research on that And what they have seen is whenever we do targeted education it works, And that's pretty much what we are trying to do here. But the goal is you have to identify that focus group that you are going for, that education particular, And the messaging needs to be very clear and focused If we can follow that. yes, Those education campaign number of cities in California and also in Maryland actually have seen decrease in their crashes just by safety campaign and awareness creating around school sparks That type of scenario. I also like the things in the plan that maybe don't jump out as education campaigns, but that, I think, would help as education campaigns. I mean, I think one of the things that I've often been struck by is the kind of difference in what, shall I say, community. I'm trying to think of the right word here. When you talk to people in our neighborhoods about gun violence and, right, the community has a pretty high level of education about that and a pretty high level of wanting to engage and to think about that themselves and so on and so forth. right, It's a little bit different, I think. still with crashes. I mean, Lee told me like 90% of roadway fatalities happen between a person and somebody who lives really close by to them, really close by. I don't think that's really in the consciousness of people who live in our neighborhoods and who drive the cars. right, So there's a difference in the feeling about whether it's a community problem or not. And so one of the things that I like that's in this plan are the community intervention. I've forgotten what you call them exactly, but I can put a planter on the corner here, right, I can. maybe we're waiting for Domi or whoever to do a speed bump, but in the meantime we can do what's in the toolkit to make the corners less blind, to do those kinds of things, And I think of that as much as anything. It will also prevent roadway crashes, but it's also a way to make sure that we're not just driving around in a car, but we're also a way for a council person to get out into their neighborhood and say: let's do a thing here, Let's get people invested in community road safety, which I also think will then start to penetrate people's consciousness in a way that is a little bit different than saying to a particular driver: hey, slow down. Thank you for that. I just have a couple other questions. My next question was about just getting a little bit more insight on the collaboration you know with the state and PennDOT. I know in the past there's been a perception that it's difficult. I actually had a meeting with the Lieutenant Governor last time I was in Harrisburg and we had a conversation, you know, with PennDOT about traffic calming on state roads. It's an issue that I talk about a lot with Councilwoman Gross and Councilwoman Strassburger because we share so many state roads, whether it's, you know, Penn Avenue or Fifth Avenue between District 7, 8 and 9, And I had a really great conversation. I sent them over a spreadsheet. I sent them a list of the state roads that were, you know, in the city that have been an issue and they're taking a look at that. But I would like to hear more about, you know, ways that you know we could work closer, you know, with PennDOT, because so many of our primary roads in the city are state roads And you know I get calls from constituents: oh I can't. you know we, you know, put speed bumps all down Penn Avenue between Braddock and Fifth Avenue. I'm like state road, like we can't, you know. So I would love to hear more about the collaboration with the state and how us as councilmembers can be helpful in that. particularly, going to Harrisburg and advocating on our behalf, Councilman, you brought, I would say, the elephant in the room. So, state route- we have only 12% state route in our city roadway- the boundary- And they're responsible closely nearly half of the crash that happen every year in the city. Five of our top ten high-severity crash corridor that we have. These are all state-owned. In the last couple of years we actually did make some really good progress when coordinating with the state. especially, you know, the Safe Street for All grant played a huge role. We are partnering with the state and also the county to develop our first Allegheny County Safety Action Plan And that also create our partners in the MPO Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission. They have started another regional safety action plan. So, whatever you create this type of avenue, that's where you get to have those discussion, talk about whatever going on in the east side and what type of issue they are having on their side, The way we can operate- unfortunately for our state partners they have to cross a lot more red tape to make those things work- And also the way we envision the project. it can be low cost, quick bill, just a flex post and paint work. When they're addressing health care- and this is a you know they're at the state level And they're at the state level We are working with them. So you know we work with them for a long time And we do a lot of work for them. So I think the state and state you know once we have the opportunity, we are working on it. they're addressing their state road. it's really difficult to bring the safety benefit just by flex post for a state road. Simply, you have a very high volume, So this type of measure doesn't work. So whenever they try to undertake their corridor, it gets really expensive. They have to go through a lot of red tape procedure. They have a lot of oversight and process that needs to go through. So that's where a lot of hang up happen. But Stephanie already brought up that they are in our fatal crash response team and we're really glad the way they're collaborating with us. Things are getting better. We get to create number of avenue through these plans where we get to talk with each other, understand how we can support each other. But the truth of the matter is there's still a long way to go on that avenue. One more thought: I think where we're making good progress is also on the road. So what is not yet built with PennDOT? So we've got this existing set of roadways And I think probably none of our roads were really built with safety in mind first. Whether we built them or PennDOT built them, that's not what people were thinking about. It is what people are thinking about now. And so the conversations with PennDOT where I feel like all right, we're getting somewhere is when maybe PennDOT will say: what if we added a lane here, That would reduce congestion? And of course we immediately think, nah, no, That would increase speed And that we can have those conversations And we can say: listen, how bad is the congestion Like? what are you really talking about here? Because every time you let people go faster, we know what's going to happen. And there's a real openness. I think there as there is a real openness to building multimodal facilities into their projects and so on. So I think there's the trying to correct for the errors of the past, which is, as Pini is saying, pretty tricky, But there's a lot of hurdles that we have to get through. And then there's the what are we doing going forward? And I think there we've made a tremendous amount of progress with PennDOT. And you said: what's the percentage of crashes that are attributed to state roads? So 12-person roadway responsible for nearly half of the total crash. Year to year it bounced from 44% to 48%, which year you're looking at? Wow, Thank you. And my final question was: I know it was shared on your Yeah, Slot deck- that last year was 17 crashes. What was? and I said it was a decrease. What was it down from? What was the prior number? So in 2023, it was 20. 2022 had been the highest for the last couple of years with 24. OK, Thank you. That's also my question, Chair. Great Thank you, Councilwoman Gross. Thank you, I don't have That many questions. I am grateful for the work that you're doing. I appreciate that we have got people kind of across multiple departments here that are working on the collaborative, So to have set the goal, to have convened the right people at the table. it seems like we're already seeing results. We all know that we have a backlog of traffic calming requests, right. I always like to give a shout out to the constituents of District 7 when, back in 2018, not only did they many, many years ago have, you know, they kind of first trial speed humps on the alley part of Goldway, which was preceded by time on council, But then we kind of we got the newer speed bumps, I think that are that were kind of the first ones that Domi had done on both on Millwood and then following up that on Edmond and Bloomfield, And that was, you know, a concerted consensus building, And so I think that's a really good kind of exercise with Domi that the constituents were very, very clear that they wanted, And I think it might even have been on the record. when we were discussing it at the table here. Council members were like that's. you're crazy. You know you shouldn't do that. People will hate it. But, as we see, my constituents were right. You know, sometimes you got to let the people lead And now we have those requests coming from all across the city. But it is. I do appreciate that you're pairing that communications and education, because people really, just they really need to slow down And we would have a lot less fatalities, certainly less injuries, and not have to do so much of the infrastructure changes if people would just drive slowly. So I applaud all of your work. I don't have any questions. Thank you, Madam Chair, Great. Thank you, Councilwoman. Thank you, Madam Chair, And thank you all And apologies for walking in late, But I think I've read the memo, or I was reviewing it, And I think I know a lot of what's in here. It's been a pleasure to have my office take part in the Vision Zero Task Force as much as we can And really grateful to your work, for especially the multidisciplinary, multi-departmental nature of it is the thing that makes it work. I've seen when it's, you know, when it preceded Domi, when it was like just DPW, like one person, and then it was, it was just Domi, And then you weren't really syncing up public safety and parking authority with Domi. It really is the thing that makes the difference. I saw that in person while attending one of- unfortunately attending- one of the fatal crash response team meetups And even just kind of daylighting for multiple people who don't spend a lot of time in like the upper Pitt campus, you know upper Oakland area, realizing, oh my gosh, this is probably the busiest area of the city traffic-wise. Yeah, It's like. oh, it's always at 530 in the morning, Like okay, let's really focus on this, Let's really take this seriously And let's work with our partners at Pitt And let's work with UPMC on, you know, their hospital entrances, And it really kind of just highlighted for me how important the multi-departmental part of this is. So really grateful, And I mean I don't have too many questions either. I think we're all on the right track here. I am curious, though: like when do we expect the pilot program, the pilot program around the city, the city's public health program around? oh, red light, I think I understand- Around neighbors, residents, kind of doing their own interventions and having that ready to roll out? Because, while I think that, you know, the plus side of the fatal crash response team is to be able to focus in on a really harmful area and make almost immediate upgrades, while we're telling them we have long-term- you know we're going to have to do this. We do have long-term upgrades to make. that might cost a little bit more. The hard part is this nature of everyone: has an issue on their street or in their neighborhood and don't feel like they have the power to take action or do anything. It's like they're at the mercy of where they are on the list and if it's approved by you know the growing, the overburdened staff, Because we have this growing list of areas that people are concerned about. So, yeah, when will they be able to take action by putting the planter there or following the instructions from thecionalists to do that? Yeah, So in terms of the kind of enforcement combination, I can also address the other one, but for the education and enforcement, I'm working on getting scheduled at all the zone council meetings. I actually did attend zone four, which was great. Yes, it was great And yeah, so we're working on drafting materials based on people's needs, for them to be able to hand out and flyer and put on cars, And we have, like zone four- commander is on board, So we're going to hopefully launch in the next month or so- the sooner the better. And then, in terms of that traffic community traffic calming, we are waiting back to hear from a grant. So if we do get that grant funding we can kind of roll that process more quickly. If not, we will reevaluate and see what we can do in the short term, But that is still kind of on the table for this year. Okay, I do think that's going to be the difference maker in terms of, like people feeling like, okay, I realize that there's a long wait, or maybe they don't know there's a long wait, but we usually tell them like: yes, this is one of even just 50 and one district alone. You know we're really working with you and as hard as we can And you know they can do something in the meantime. So I think that we've heard loud and clear that there's interest in this community or resident based neighborhood traffic calming toolkit. I think the act of putting together A grant proposal really helped us sort of put pen to paper of what that would look like. So I'm hopeful that, even if we don't get a grant, there's going to be this grant that we applied for. There will be other opportunities, But, yes, having to discuss. you know what does an application process look like, What are somebody still needs to review, say yes or no. There's a question of liability and who carries it. There's quite a number of things that have to get sorted. the cost of materials: you know where we store them, Where we purchase them. Laying the groundwork through this grant proposal, I think, was really beneficial and it came together truly through the Vision Zero working group. We had to rely heavily on Stephanie to pull together that proposal. This probably all goes without saying, but the The point at which our law department became comfortable with it and DPW became comfortable with it. DPW just wants to be sure that what people are building is doesn't create additional hazards or can doesn't melt the first time it rains or you know. they have some specifications. So if a planter, then the planter should be like this, if should be like this, and I think they're they're kind of putting those specs together which I think will help clarify for everybody. and then you know, and then we need to. I think we have actually figured out. So once it's in the right of way, It's ours And people probably need to understand that a little bit about it as well, because if it turns out it is creating more of a hazard or it's not up to spec or it does melt when it rains or something we probably have to go in and take it out or something. So we're going to need to do some education with people about how together we're managing – we're creating more safety. but we have to make sure we're not creating additional risk and we're kind of owning this project together, because we want people to do it and we want them also not to get super upset if we say: you know, we've got to back this thing up eight inches because it's – so we're really going to have to collaborate on these. but I think it's going to be fantastic. Yeah, and even having neighborhoods collaborate with other neighborhoods, because I'm thinking back to the early days of the pandemic and the play – like the play streets and we had the sandwich boy Mm-hmm And we had the boards and we gave them out and designated play streets and people loved that. and then we're really upset when we sort of decommissioned that program because it wasn't needed anymore And so, like the expectations on the front end as well, along with you know how permanent or how temporary these might be. Yeah, it's all very complicated, but okay, But will, I think, ultimately be a great thing. And no, I don't have any other questions. Thank you all, Yeah, thank you, Yeah. so yeah, thank you all, you know, for being here. I just think, generally speaking, you know, when we talk about traffic calming, this issue it has all been on the shoulders of DELMI for a long time. I don't know if we have numbers on how many projects we've done around the city. I know it's a lot. I don't know, Angie, if you have any – Dozens a year, Dozens a year. And in addition, we do signal replacement and signal adjustment projects. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, And we do. you know we do a lot of projects too. So you know lots of work, very expensive work, being done all over the city And you know there's always some frustration. I think for some residents with traffic calming anything that's new, you know, and folks who aren't you know, folks who have lived here for a long time, they're like: well, why do we? you know what I mean. This doesn't I don't need this Like, I'm a good driver, you know. But it's different now, right, Cars are significantly bigger, Significantly bigger. People are on their phones, so distracted in a way that we haven't seen before. Speeding, I don't know. I always sort of challenge myself sometimes, you know, like if you drive the speed limit, like 25 miles an hour, it feels very slow, Like you're like, oh wow, I'm going really slow, But that's you know. and also we have a lot more vulnerable road users, right, All kinds of folks now who are biking and e-bikes, and people have their kids on bikes and you know what I mean, And you know folks walking in here and there. So I think that's important to keep in mind. I will say just to sort of shout out to Domi: you know I really do love the data-driven approach. You know, I think in past years it- and I notice it myself too- Like you'll sort of You'll see, you know early investments in traffic calming were sort of like maybe it was a little bit more of a squeaky wheel approach. So you'll sort of be in a neighborhood and you'll see like half a million dollars of infrastructure on a little tiny, you know, intersection And it's like, oh man, this could have been how many speed bumps, like in other places. So you know, I'm grateful that you guys are taking that. you know, on the high injury network, safe routes to school. That's what we should be doing And that's just to also remind folks when they are asking for speed humps. that's how we're doing it right. We're doing it based on the need. Actually, one quick. Donna, would you want to come up to the table, Because I know that crossing guards are a big part And I know lots of folks have some questions on crossing guards. So that is kind of my first. Okay, So my first question would be: you know what is the crossing guards? Because I know I have requests for crossing guards at big intersections. in Squirrel Hill, in Hazelwood, We're hiring. things are a little bit different And what can you tell us about sort of how things are going in the crossing guard world? The crossing guards are hiring, So anybody across the city can apply. You need to live in the city. We also get requests for crossing guards, But we go out. We go out and evaluate the intersection, Things like the amount of students that intersection serves, safety issues, pluses and minuses to safety. Is it a stop sign, Is it an intersection where there's a light signal Or is it just a crosswalk? I'll give you some examples: South Dallas and Edgerton. We only have a crosswalk to get kids across that street And those people speed on that street Speed. So that would be an intersection that you know we look at. There's some other ones that we're working with DOME, where we definitely need to have somebody up there And as soon as we can either reallocate some resources- meaning some of our people- or bring new people on, there's intersections that are on the list- that will be getting a crossing guard As soon as we get people in. So it's a process, It is, And sometimes it takes longer than what some people would like. You know they think they can snap your fingers and you get a crossing guard, But it's a little bit more extensive than that. But the safety of the children in this city is most important And part of it is also teaching young people and adults. This is going to sound so just basic, but crossing the street I'm usually out all over the city, whether it's special events or just engaging with people, And the amount of people that I see that cross against a light while they're holding their child's hand is unacceptable. And it's interesting because I have these discussions with the people in this building, because I am here a lot down here at the city county building, Yeah, And I'm at 4th and Grant And I'm probably the only person that stands there and waits to get the walk sign, And I do that on purpose, because you never know who's watching you. There could be people on a school bus, and it doesn't have to be downtown, It could be anywhere, Penn Avenue. There's people, there's young people on school buses that are always watching everything we do. So it's time for for everybody in the city: adults. It starts with adults- To moms, To kids- And I have a lot of kids And it's really a great way to model the behavior that we want our children to emulate in when it comes to safety in crossing the streets. So- And I know that there was some chatter And I remember seeing a news report, something, and I don't know if this is but a ticketing system, like if you're going around the bus, like if the bus has the stop sign. Oh, yes, Can you talk a little bit about that? Sure, Also, could you identify yourself for the record, McManus, I'm the supervisor for the city of Pittsburgh crossing guards. Pittsburgh Public Schools implemented a program where they have cameras on the buses, where the camera is on the stop arm that comes out, and they implemented it about a year and a half ago and people were getting tickets. they told everybody that this was going to happen and folks were getting tickets and they were all upset and there was something about the processing of it and that was changed. so I believe Penn- Penn dot, I think- is who is taking care of the tickets, and Pittsburgh Public Schools just put out about a month ago, they issued nine thousand, nine thousand tickets just for going through bus lights. how much is that ticket do we know? I believe it's 300, 300, mm-hmm, but there's no points on the license though. but they had people who went in disputed it and I believe maybe 100 tickets were valid and they're paying. So it really is a nice program where people think that they don't go around the bus And my people call me when they have cars going around the buses and then I send the information over to Pittsburgh Public Schools with a time, a location and the bus number, and that way it makes it easier for Pittsburgh Public to pull it up on their camera. So I probably weekly, I have guards who call and say there's people going through bus lights and intersections, which is also unacceptable. Yeah, thank you. So for the red light cameras, do we have locations identified or does it change? Can they move around? How does that just? how's that gonna work? So, briefly, for our planned automated red light enforcement program, we're looking for a fixed unit system, So the locations are not gonna change. There's a lot of reasons for that, but you know, it's the cost, it's that they have to be properly signed, it's that they have to be properly advertised. There's a 60 or 90 day warning period at each new location where we can't actually assess a citation, So they'll stay in one location. And the second question is: have we identified locations? The answer to that is: we've identified locations in collaboration with PennDOT: potential locations based on crash factors and other requirements of the ARLI program. We will wait to finalize those locations, though, until we have a vendor in place, because there's certain speed studies that we'll wanna have, or not speed studies, certain traffic studies that we'll wanna have complete at those locations before we actually install cameras. So, all that to say, we have an idea, but we do not have the locations identified yet. Thank you, Sure, Councilman, you have a follow-up. Thank you, Madam Chair. I was gonna just follow up with one of our the school and the school bus conversation for a minute. I think it was in the Complete Streets Post agenda, which might've been a year ago, might've been two years ago, I can't even remember now- when we were talking a little bit about the metrics and how we prioritize that, I asked if we were not only prioritizing where our physical schools are for kids who are walking to school. but most of our kids don't actually walk to school and they take the buses right. especially the younger kids are taking the PPS buses. and even though it changes from year to year- because the location of the PPS bus stops change and which schools are picked up when and how many kids are going to a particular corner changes, I asked- I think, that we request that information from PPS and I think that's gotten a lot better. It used to be that it was very hard to get- And then look at those as a higher ranking, because the safety of kids walking to their school bus stop should also be, I think, high in the priority area. There are certainly school bus stops that have something like two and a half hours of pickups in the morning and two and a half hours of drop-offs in the afternoon, and one of these- years ago it may have changed- was Heron and Melwood and Poets Hill because it was 16 different schools and it was a lot of kids walking to school and it was a lot of school buses going to that corner every morning and every afternoon And it was unsafe, especially when we were having Bigelow Boulevard construction and people were using the alternate detour, unofficial detour route and driving at high speeds on Melwood and on Heron And so, similarly, I can think of school bus stops in my districts where we've had to push over the years to get even striping for crosswalks, Like there weren't even crosswalks and there was two hours of little kids And you have to walk your little kids to the school bus because it's not safe to even go to the bus stop. So if we haven't gotten to that level, I think that needs to be added for the Vision Zero Task Force right to look at where those school bus stops are and what are the routes to bus stops. Thank you, Yeah, thanks, And so yeah, with regard to the sort of education engagement. so it sounds like we're working with Propel. Are we working with PPS as well? Is that like getting inside the classroom? Yeah, so our Safe Routes to School Coordinator maintains relationships with PPS as well as some of the magnet and other charter schools And, yeah, it's primarily around getting those schools to participate in programs such as Safe Routes to School, Safety Week, Walk and Roll to School Week, Our Safe Routes to School Coordinator. I think has a great has built great relationships to public safety. Donna is nodding her head To our Traffic Division. she really she serves a role whose entire purpose is to make sure that students can get safely to school, regardless of how they are traveling, And so as part of that role, I think she almost provides a sort of you know liaison sort of service to try to solve with the schools the types of issues that they bring to us. Agree, absolutely, we can still be doing more. I think our students in Pittsburgh are facing a tremendous uphill battle when it comes to transportation, especially in light of some of the changes that could happen to PRT. This was a challenge that we were hearing from our schools even before PRT announced these potential cuts is that there was already, you know, concerns about students having to find the bus, wait for the bus, catch the bus, in some cases, transfer. So we've already been working to try to add more sort of multi-modal training how to use the bus for students, because they're being put in this position of having PPS buses. Yeah, the PPS buses, yeah, PPS transportation changes. So, yes, all that to say, children are our most vulnerable users And I think- to draw back to the point earlier about how important behavior and sort of consciousness is, we're also, through our Safe Routes to School work, training the next generation of drivers, cyclists, everything. So the more I think that we treat those children with the compassion and you know, the level of safety which they absolutely deserve and foster sort of respect for them and each other. I hope that you know we start to see that pay off as they get older And we do hope to expand our Safe Routes to School program to also be working within some of the higher level grades. So I think at this point we've only gone up to eighth grade. We aspire to get into high school classrooms to also start to talk to students about who might be approaching driving age. Great, great, I always. I think like fifth and sixth graders is a good. That's like the sweet spot where they learn something and then they tell their parents what they're doing wrong And they're also looking- That is my experience- And they're also looking for independence And I think movement and mobility is a form of independence And, you know, in a city where you might have to take the bus to school or find your own way to after school program, you know, I hope that we're making transit cycling, you know, those options for non-drivers, especially because of age, comfortable, healthy and safe. Yeah, for sure, for sure. So, and then just quickly so, with the Community Traffic Calming Toolkit, and I understand that we're waiting on a grant. So I mean, is this: Are we kind of talking about creating like a sort of like a menu, Like you'd apply for an encroachment permit, and this would kind of be like the menu where it's like, if you do this, it should be quick. Is that the idea? Yeah, we'd like to get to a point where there's a sort of menu of options and treatments where they might be accessible or acceptable, And then, of course, the internal process for how those requests would be submitted to the city for review. So, yes, Great, yeah, And I mean I think that would be so nice because they're so. I mean I've had even just little things, like folks who park up to the edge of the curb, right, And you can't see out, And it's just, And it's very frustrating for residents to feel like, well, I can't just put a flex post in there, And it's just they. It's hard to understand the amount of sort of time and engineering that it goes into, But if they could just do that quickly themselves, I think that would make things a lot easier. So definitely looking forward to that. I do have a question. So I've noticed I see we have a parking authority here. We don't have the Bureau of Police, But I am curious about the enforcement. So Prior to Chief Raglan leaving, I know that he was very active in the Vision Zero team And I know that in Zone 4 with Commander Vanansky, we're doing a pilot to have like dedicated officers in a neighborhood and have that kind of move around. I'm curious if we have an update on that, And I would. also I would love to see numbers too, Like not only Not that I, I know we're trying to change behaviors, but I also want to know how many Yes sickets we're giving out. Myself and Commander Ripple have been on the Vision Zero's subcommittee for enforcement. One of the things that we are bringing about is we looked at some data from our data analysts in reference to pedestrian strikes and things of that nature- serious injuries- And with that we took the, The pallet will come for the, The zone that had the most pedestrian strikes, which was Zone 2. So we in the future we'll roll that out quarterly meeting to see what we can do to stop the pedestrian strikes. We will go over each report from the police department And through those reports we'll see We'll all have input on how we can do better enforcement in those areas and what, What things, What measures we can put in place to stop those strikes. Yeah, because I mean I really would like. I mean I feel like as a driver in Pittsburgh you kind of feel like anything, Like you're never going to get a ticket right, Like it would just be almost unheard- I mean occasionally right, But it's almost unheard of- that you see a police car, you know, and I think that if folks kind of knew that- you never know, if that were the vibe, then people would stop at the stop sign or, like you know, slow down a little bit. So that would be great to see sort of all of our officers trained Like if you're out and you're not on a call, you're actually actively, you know out, you know whether it's at a stop sign or whether it's a presence or you're actually doing some kind of enforcement. That would be great. Yeah, and Yeah, the Fatal Crash Response Team. So these are the examples. I think that that was very helpful to see those. I do have one, so this is specific to my district. So there was a fatal crash on St Patrick's Day. It was a head-on collision, It was a drunk-driving incident And the Fatal Crash Response Team came out to look And, by the way, I think that that I can't remember if it was Commander Venanski, but one of He described how going out together, like with Domi, was so helpful, because normally it's like, okay, you just go out, okay, who hit who, whatever, write the report, But to actually have, like the traffic engineer being like, oh my gosh, look at this. Like you know, this is why I went, you know, and figuring out why the crash happened, but for the Beachwood and Loretta. so one of the things that came out of that Fatal Crash Response visit was to move a bus stop up to a signaled intersection and eliminate a dangerous crosswalk. And I just wanted to give you all the chance to clarify, because I know on Facebook some people are like: what? That's not, That has nothing to do with And correct. it doesn't have anything to do with the crash at hand, but I wanted to let you all explain how that came about. Absolutely Before getting into the nitty-gritty detail, I just want to give a big shout-out to the people who actually helped us to go through all those crashes and it was immensely helpful for us along the way. A little bit background: how does Fatal Crash Response work? So we do mostly not only reactive, we also try to be proactive whenever we look for those response. And the other thing is we try to do low-cost, quick-build project that can be designed in-house and can build in-house. So you know we have a lot of people who are interested in this. For that particular matter, Councilwoman, the crash happened somewhere around 8. 30- 9 o'clock at night. The individual was under the influence. They basically crossed the central lane and hit on the other side and that's where the fatality happened. So between 2019 and 2023, we have over 4,000 crash due to DUI. One in every five crash that happened was due to DUI. So that's the number of fatalities that happened in our city regarding DUI And one in every five fatality that happened in our city regarding DUI. So that particular incident, when we went there and Detective Wolf helped us to walk us through how that crash happened. it doesn't look like roadway factor actually played any major role to have that crash. So from the reactive side we have a local viewpoint from the city side how we can stop alcohol abuse, DUI, You know. so the toolkit that we have with our hand we don't necessarily have in the toolkit to address. the issue that we have is alcohol abuse. The individual didn't mention they have any issue in their roadway condition. The individual didn't mention that the central line wasn't clear enough. There wasn't enough lighting in there. So the individual didn't necessarily mention that roadway actually played any role that can prevent that crash to happen. Now there are some other toolkit that we could have used for a lane departure type of crash. but the problem is that corridor has close to 29,000 traffic and close to 8% truck traffic. The thing that you can do, this type of lane departure from the central line, is whether you can harden the central line. It can be rumble strip but you can do that as a residential corridor. Three o'clock in the morning, a free trailer hitting that rumble strip, it ain't gonna be a fun experience. We could have tried to put a flex post in there for our 29,000 traffic in the middle of a two-feet, basically, space that we have. That thing doesn't last either. So, as you can see, when you are thinking about the process of the reactive side, there isn't anything actually we could have done that could have prevented that crash. So that brings you to the next point is how you can proactive. So that's when we see that we have that crosswalk, that really sad crosswalk between Two Signal 29,000 traffic, four-lane roadway, really fast, There is no way you can make that crossing safer. We also looked into the PRT data. We wanted to make sure that we are not taking out any crossing which is heavily used. The ridership is 0. 7, not even a whole human being- per daily. It's like a three-day. maybe one or two people cross, You do the average. that's how it ended up being 0. 7. So that crossing isn't also being heavily utilized to begin with. So the only low-cost response we had on that point to make sure that no one is using that corridor, because we are seeing that's a safety concern right there that we can solve with the toolkit that we have In a quick response time that we have, And that is the reason we took out that crossing and put it on the Signal S section that we have. That doesn't mean that that crossing isn't needed. But the problem is at this moment, the resource that we have, we won't be able to deploy anything that actually work and improve that scenario. But the good thing is the I-376 project is coming in there- squirrel interchange- and there will be some changes coming in the upstream of Beechwood Boulevard. So when that project gets in maybe it will give us some more opportunity to better understand how that corridor work, whether we can do something more expensive like a road type of scenario instead of four making two lanes. So when we get into those timeline, yes, that will give us more resource to work with and figure out how we can make that crossing safer. But at this moment the only proactive thing we can do to make sure that we don't have to go there and address any of this issue that sad incidents- is take out that crosswalk. So that's how we decided to make up that crosswalk out. It might feel like you hurt in your leg and you put a bandaid in your forehead, But the thing is, since the whole process is proactive and reactive, that's how that decision has been made. Yeah, no, I appreciate that And it's funny. I had a funny conversation with a constituent who's a very strong bike ped advocate And they were telling me how they use that crosswalk and they stare down the cars and they're very aggressive And I'm like I get it, But we don't want someone doing that necessarily when they're with a kid or have a kid, you know. So, right, So it was just: we identified dangerous pedestrian infrastructure and that's why Staring probably can work in your neighborhood street, But when your corridor has 29,000 traffic, yeah, it gets really difficult. Yeah, yeah, for sure, Thank you, Yeah, so I guess I guess just one thing I wanted to let you all do since you is to just go down for each of you in your various departments. you know what. what for you feels so far, I mean- and this is just the first year, right? So what feels so far like the best outcome of being involved in this Vision Zero project? I can start. I think the fatal crash response team has been really impactful, Just having the opportunity to be involved in this project, Just having better communication across departments, And this is something that's not established in a lot of cities in the country. So I think it's something innovative that we're doing And I'm hoping that it. I think it's already paying off, but I hope it continues to pay off. For me, it has been the collaboration that we've had within the budget engagement subcommittee, And I think that's for a few reasons. One is, while I have said that we cannot design or engineer our way to complete roadway safety, we know that that absolutely is a part of the solution And that, you know, while our traffic calming program, our neighborhood traffic calming program- is a very popular program, we know that there are higher ticket items that we could be funding. So something that stuck with me from our Complete Streets Advisory Group report when we were in front of council buildings about a year ago was, where we install upgraded signal infrastructure, we reduce crashes by 33%. That tells me that we need to be upgrading more of our outdated traffic signals and we need money to be able to do that. And so being able to work with our colleagues in the Office of Management and Budget, our grants department, to talk about how we do that better, faster, quicker, scaling up- you know, having the dollars and resources to do it is absolutely part of the process And that's been a game changer, I think, for just a few years, And now we need to have people who are giving us the answers so we are able to be more flexible about how we're going to do this. And I think one issue that has been important in the last year or so for Domi in year one is that those conversations have happened and we'll be delivering more projects as a result. I will bring two things here. The first thing is the collaboration that we are having now with our state partner, our MPO, our public safety friends, our parking authority. we never had those connections before. Division Zero Movement. It was a. we had those connections but not the level that we are having. huge help for us. and the other thing is the way we utilize this momentum and the administration helped us to recruit more in-house staff. that was a big help for us. the amount of project that you are seeing that city is delivering. a major reason is our in-house capacity any given time whenever we are doing those small skill work- five thousand to ten thousand dollar- if we lash it out to outside consultant that we are doing in-house, each of the planning work that we are doing, whether it's a Stanton Avenue work that we completed, we are gonna have more projects coming in this year in the district three, we are doing all those in-house work that are saving around fifty to sixty thousand dollar on average. we do a lot of signal work in-house that many community have to hire outside consultant and the amount of money we use just for construction, they use this for design alone. so using this momentum and hiring those stuff in and the way we are doing all those project very efficient and cheap way, I feel like is a huge win for the vision zero program and I do feel like it will. we will see a lot more benefit coming in in the coming years because of this in-house staff capacity we were able to build up with the movement of vision zero, and I would double down on what Panini said, that with the collaboration aspect of it, just working, working with subject matter experts on the various topics that we need to address- makes the job that much more easier. for a good example was today. we were in a meeting and Donna was there and she brought up in the meeting how she wanted to address certain aspects of crossing. I was like, oh, I know the perfect meeting for you and I told her about today's meeting and then I also told her about another meeting that we'll have to just to talk about crossing, and so it makes it that much more easier just to have the subject matter experts in the room. and then the documentation going through, the memorandum and the documentation that Stephanie's put together for a group- it- looking at the numbers, it makes it all worth it. it shows us what we've been doing for the last year and how how much work we have, how much progress we have made and how much progress we will make. so that makes it much more rewarding. I feel like everybody's gonna say the same thing, but I think what I would say is it's, it's, it is all of the collaboration and I think the collaboration as a model really for other places where we have to try to build the same kinds of teams to solve the problem. so I mean, you know concretely, when people start, or certain leaders begin, they start thingsaking and as Well I- you're right, the calm is ever don't miss the on revenues and how much progress we have made and how much progress we have made. so that makes it much more Qu. start to work like this with PennDOT, with one another, then we can make a real plan for that. you know when you're talking about the bus stop and we move it to the signalized intersection. it's not just that we do that there, it's that we are tying that to the changes that are coming at the Squirrel Hill interchange right, So that we are how to put this. we're doing the kind of long range planning which is not about having a vision document and hoping, but because we all know each other's brains well enough, now we can sketch those plans in reality, we can plan the money for them, we can do so much more with the resources that we have because we've collaborated, And for that reason we treat this group a little bit like a look and see for other groups. come and watch and see how these folks are doing it. figure out how to dig in in your own areas and we go a lot farther, a lot faster and get our heads like not so much in the clouds in terms of long range planning, but actually the kind of nitty gritty of it. Are you gonna- I mean, I'm not sure if you're gonna, I'm not sure if you're gonna- talk about neighborhood guards or not. You can. So I just it, just you know, in the area of you know- bring people in and talk to them about what are your obstacles to doing this right with our crossing guards. you know we have more slots for crossing guards than we have crossing guards And when we talk to people, why are you not crossing guard? You know the way that the seniority system worked in the contract is everybody with seniority picks first and then, if you don't have seniority, you go to the place. nobody else picked. but maybe you are a neighbor who would be perfectly happy to be at an intersection. I live in- I don't know wherever I live- Lawrenceville and I would cross there, but I'm not getting in a car. I don't have a car to go and be at the empty spot in Carrick. And so what Donna and her guards did was to bargain into the contract a different kind of guard which is called a neighborhood guard. So city guards who wanna do all of that- and they go and they take their- can do that. But if there is a place where Donna has evaluated and said we could use a guard here and no city guard takes it, then it's possible for her to go and recruit right out of the neighborhood. or you can recruit out of your neighborhood or you can recruit out of your neighborhood and say, hey, we've got a spot now we've got budget for it, and if there's somebody who would like to work the early hours and cross the kids and then come back later and work the hours, So there, look, see. So and I just wanna it's that you know to just really dig in with people and talk to them about how do we solve the problem. and solve it has been, like you know, super rewarding and everyone can learn from it. Can I just say congratulations, Because that has been a complaint for 10 years. Thank you, That is amazing. That is amazing amazing work. That has been an unfixable problem for a decade That people they've been empty seats. I remember we, you know, we were trying to get across the guard 10 years ago on Butler Street at Arsenal, and that was one of the problems: Like there hadn't been a new hire of crossing guards forever because of this unsolvable problem that you've just solved. And so we were lucky to get like the first hire ever and to get a crossing guard there, because, again, you know, that's a K through five. They're, you know, five year olds trying to cross a Penn dot street, right, It's very dangerous. So, yeah, it's a very it's a horrible intersection, So it's a that is magnificent. I think we all should do like advertising campaigns as council members, that you can apply to be a crossing guard and stay in your neighborhood, because that has been the obstacle for a decade, maybe longer, That's a decade as long as I've been aware of it. It has, Yes, It has, it really has. The other thing, though, that precipitated this neighborhood guard is we, about two years ago, eliminated the requirement of a driver's license in a car And with that happening, that eliminated a lot of people who would want this job. And I do have people who use PRT. I have guards that are up in Northview Heights who are over in Squirrel Hill. That's where they bid on their spot And they take PRT every day back and forth. So that's, it's moving forward, trying to eliminate the obstacles of why people don't want this job. I mean, it's the best job ever, And for somebody who's retired it's really the best job ever because it gets you up in the morning, It gets you moving. You go do your corner for maybe two. some of my corners are three hours. Some of my corners have more than probably 20 buses. Up on the North side there's some really active corners, So it just depends. But then you have the middle of the day to schedule your doctor's appointments or run your errands, And then you go back, Get the kids off the bus, Say hello And you go home. No paperwork, No hassles And no supervisor. that's breathing down your neck every day because you're on the corner by yourself. So I'm just checking to make sure the camera was on you. I think we could just cut there and just put that on. We've got our television commercial right there. We're going to put it up on social media. It is the best job It is. I appreciate it. It is. I know My staff is going to be applying now. I just wanted to say that it was great, being a part of this committee, for the parking authority to be at the table, have a seat at the table just to see what other city entities are doing and working with everybody. It's been great And I'm looking forward to it in the future. So actually, just quickly, because we haven't really heard. So are there? because I know that it's been a challenge with enforcing people parking on sidewalks, sort of at non-metered spots. Do you have any? No, No, No, I don't. I don't Any comments on that or forward-looking on how we might be able to do a little bit more of that type of enforcement through the parking authority. Hopefully with the advancements in automated enforcement as that comes with the new systems that we may be getting in the future, hopefully that we can work on those different types of parking situations as that comes to light. Great, Great. So anyone else have any last questions? No, Any questions, or Oh, go ahead, Oh, sorry, OK, So what? everybody talked about collaboration and that's incredible that these folks all came together, But nobody talked about each person's expertise sitting around this table in Vision Zero, And really and truly that's what I think makes this group a group that can make changes, And I think that's what I think makes this group a group that can make changes. And so I think it's. There's people around the table right here. Obviously, please let us get past anybody harming the viewers and fortune lumps. From what we've seen, everyone is exhale this week applause. I just had two just quick questions. The first one primarily for the public: Can you share some examples of what the community-led traffic calming interventions might look like? Yeah, so some of the things I think that you can expect to look forward to will be things like: what type of planter can I place? How close. does it need to be from the intersection? Some of the other things we've talked about, Stephanie, if you can help me: Yeah, I think we've talked about like physically painting Things like that. If we have cones we can use or sandwich boards we can use, Again, bringing that back Just like very quick things that we can do that aren't going to require them to like bolt in the flex post. Yeah, no construction, no cutting sawing, Yeah, everything sort of surface placement- Awesome. and in my last question was around the automated speed enforcement. Is there any current legislation in Harrisburg right now and what like steps are being taken? Because it's something that I'm really interested in and we actually, at our meeting this morning, talked about how there's a growing, you know, hunger to be more visible in Harrisburg as a body, And we're starting to put together our list of asks- and this would be on my list that I would, you know, share with the members- that we need to ask for, Obviously, more funding for public transportation as well. But is there a current status of where this is among your group and you know what would be the next steps and how can we, you know, kind of tap in to this effort as well and take this to Harrisburg, Because I think this is something because we know, you know we don't have. you know, 1300. you know police officers like we did, like in the 80s or 90s, like when, you know, when I was a kid, And you know we, you know there's only just so much. you know, physical Enforcement the human beings can do, but if we had automated speed enforcement I think that would go a long way to behavioral change. and someone knows that there's an invisible eye in the sky, so to speak. you know, watching them go 60 miles an hour down Butler Street, so to speak. Yeah, yeah, so I'm not quite sure if somebody else knows they can answer for me, but I can check if there's currently legislation. Last we had been involved, only Philadelphia got authorized. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. And they only got authorized in that legislation and they only got authorized for five locations. So there's been some resistance in the state legislature to automated speed enforcement for various reasons, but we would appreciate collaboration there for sure. Thank you, Madam Chair. Sure anyone else. Thank you to all the panelists. No, Okay, great, Well, yeah, so just, you know, for, for the public, please slow down, Everyone driving, driving fast and not paying attention is costing us a lot of money. I know a lot of people say, well, you're spending money on these, you know traffic calming- Well, yeah, it's, it's important, I don't know. maybe we should start the 25 mile an hour challenge and put like a little sticker on your speedometer there right at 25, and, you know, get the feeling for what it feels like. Thank you all so much. I'm this is such a fantastic program and just all the work that you're doing around slowing folks down and keeping kids safe. it's something that's very dear to me and I know to, to other members here, and so so many, so many folks in the public, whether it's parents, whether it's transit riders, whether it's cyclists. right, we, really we. we want Pittsburgh to be a place that you, you know, that you feel comfortable and safe getting around, you know, without a car. So, thank you all very much. Thanks, Oh, I guess. yeah, yeah, yeah, deal, yeah thing because, hey, we'll see you next time. oh, the postg, ter, Thank you.
